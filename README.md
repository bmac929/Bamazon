# Bamazon
Bamazon serves as online store to purchase various items. Upon loading the app, Bamazon will show all the items that are for sale and ask what is the id number associated with the item the user wants to purchase. The user will enter the id number of the item they want to purchase then the user will only see that item along with its cost and quantity available. Bamazon will then ask how many units the user would like to purchase, and the user will enter in the amount they would like to purchase. If there is enough of the item to fill the user's order, a total cost will be displayed and the store will be updated with the new available quantity. If there is not enough to fill the user's order, a message will be displayed stating that there is insufficient quantity. The user will then be taken back to the prompt to ask what is the id number of the item they would like to purchase.
 After installing the necessary modules, the user will type "node Bamazon.js" into the terminal to start the app. 
 
 1. Enter 'node bamazon.js'

I used inquirer and mySQL to develop this app.
